	In the past few years elliptic curve cryptography has moved from a

	Elliptic curves offer major advances on older systems such as increased
	speed, less memory and smaller key sizes. As digital signatures become
	more and more important in the commercial world the use of elliptic
	curve-based signatures will become all pervasive. This book summarizes
	knowledge built up within Hewlett-Packard over a number of years,
	and explains the mathematics behind practical implementations of
	elliptic curve systems. Due to the advanced nature of the mathematics
	there is a high barrier to entry for individuals and companies to
	this technology. Hence this book will be invaluable not only to mathematicians
	wanting to see how pure mathematics can be applied but also to engineers
	and computer scientists wishing (or needing) to actually implement
	such systems.

	Additionally, a modi¯cation to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm is
	
	presented for the GCD calculation required by Cantor's algorithm.
	On

	as well as between vehicles and roadside infrastructures. Currently
	available software tools for VANET research still lack the ability
	to asses the usability of vehicular applications. In this article,
	we present Traffic Control Interface (TraCI) a technique for interlinking
	road traffic and network simulators. It permits us to control the
	behavior of vehicles during simulation runtime, and consequently
	to better understand the influence of VANET applications on traffic
	patterns. In contrast to the existing approaches, i.e., generating
	mobility traces that are fed to a network simulator as static input
	files, the online coupling allows the adaptation of drivers' behavior
	during simulation runtime. This technique is not limited to a special
	traffic simulator or to a special network simulator. We introduce
	a general framework for controlling the mobility which is adaptable
	towards other research areas. We describe the basic concept, design
	decisions and the message format of this open-source architecture.
	Additionally, we provide implementations for non-commercial traffic
	and network simulators namely SUMO and ns2, respectively. This coupling
	enables for the first time systematic evaluations of VANET applications
	in realistic settings.},

	as their omnipresence has
	
	made the need for security and privacy preserving mechanisms particularly
	important. Thus, as
	
	FPGAs become integral parts of embedded systems, it is imperative
	to consider their security as
	
	a whole. This contribution provides a state-of-the-art description

	advantages of reconfigurable
	
	hardware for cryptographic applications, show potential security problems
	of FPGAs, and
	
	provide a list of open research problems. Moreover, we summarize both
	public and symmetric-key
